DILS:
DILS (Disk Image List) is a small program that gets the details of the files contained in a disk image
in one of two ways, either just the names of the files, or an extended list of details
for each file in the disk image.

To run dils you first need to compile the code with one of the following options:
1. Check for errors in the code (there should be none) 
  gcc -Wall -Werror -I. -o dils dils.c driver.c
2. No error checking (you have faith in my code) (bad idea)
  gcc -I. -o dils dils.c driver.c

After compilation, you can then run dils in one of two ways:
1. List only the file names of a disk image with the command (ls command in unix):
  ./dils <diskImage>

2. List the file names with details (ls -al in unix):
  ./dils <diskImage> -l


DICPO:
DICPO (Disk Image Copy Out) is a small program that will copy a file from a provided disk image to the user's
current working directory.

To run DICPO you first need to compile using one of two options
1. Check for errors in my code (smart idea)
  gcc -Wall -Werror -I. -o dicpo dicpo.c driver.c

2. No error checking (cmon man...)
  gcc -I. -o dicpo dicpo.c driver.c

After compilationm, you can then run dicpo to copy the file from the disk image
to your current working directory using the command:

./dicpo <diskImage> <fileName>
